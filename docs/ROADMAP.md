# RAG-Quest Development Roadmap

A phased roadmap for RAG-Quest, an AI-powered D&D-style text RPG with LightRAG knowledge graph backend.

## Design Philosophy

**Core Principle**: LightRAG does the heavy lifting. The LLM narrator is kept lightweight (Gemma 4 E2B/E4B—2-4B parameters, ≤8K context) because it doesn't memorize the world. LightRAG's dual-level retrieval (entity + vector matching) injects precisely the relevant knowledge per query. This enables RAG-Quest to run entirely on consumer hardware with local models via Ollama.

This philosophy shapes every version.

## v0.8.0 (Current) — Web UI & Streaming

**Status**: ✅ Complete — FastAPI web server, streaming SSE turns, static browser client, cross-device save sync, turn-loop parity, from_dict hardening.

### What's New in v0.8.0

**Web UI**
- ✅ `FastAPI` app with `/healthz`, `/saves`, `/session/load`, `/session/{id}/state` endpoints
- ✅ `/session/{id}/turn` (non-streaming) and `/session/{id}/turn/stream` (SSE streaming)
- ✅ Static vanilla-JS browser client with dark-mode terminal aesthetic
- ✅ Left-side auto-scrolling narrator pane, right-side state panel, bottom input
- ✅ `rag-quest serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000` CLI launcher

**Streaming Narrator**
- ✅ `Narrator.stream_action()` yields tokens for live prose rendering
- ✅ `BaseLLMProvider.stream_complete()` with safe single-chunk fallback
- ✅ OllamaProvider streams line-delimited JSON; OpenAI/OpenRouter use shared SSE parser
- ✅ Rich `Live` panel for CLI, `EventSource` for browser

**Cross-Device Save Sync (v0.8)**
- ✅ `WorldExporter.export_world(..., save_file=...)` bundles player save into `.rqworld`
- ✅ `WorldImporter.extract_campaign()` unpacks world + save to `~/.local/share/rag-quest/`
- ✅ `rag-quest export-campaign <name> [out.rqworld]` and `rag-quest import-campaign <file>` CLI subcommands

**Turn-Loop Parity**
- ✅ Shared `rag_quest/engine/turn.py` helpers: `collect_pre_turn_effects()`, `collect_post_turn_effects()`, `advance_one_turn()`
- ✅ Web endpoints and CLI loop call the same mechanics (world events, party loyalty, timeline, module gating, achievements)
- ✅ Pre-turn and post-turn payloads in all turn endpoints

**Hardening**
- ✅ `from_dict` deserializers guard against corrupted saves via `safe_enum()` and `filter_init_kwargs()`
- ✅ WebUI bug fixes: turn counter display, markdown rendering in narrator panel, inventory sidebar state
- ✅ State parser healing patterns guard against false-positives (enemy self-healing no longer credits player)
- ✅ State parser damage extraction uses word-boundary matching

---

## v0.7.0 — Modular Adventures & Hub Bases

**Status**: ✅ Complete — the full v0.7 epic shipped as save format v3 with 55+ new tests.

### What's New in v0.7.0

**Hub Bases**
- ✅ `Base` entity in `engine/bases.py` with storage Inventory, stationed NPCs, service roles, upgrades
- ✅ `/base claim [name]` escape hatch + narrator-driven claim detection (`StateChange.claim_base` rule)
- ✅ `/base here` Rich panel grouping stationed NPCs by service (`Base.npcs_by_service()`)
- ✅ `/base station <npc> [as <service>]` binds NPCs to canonical service roles (smith, healer, innkeeper, storage, stable, library)
- ✅ `/base talk <npc> <message>` — scoped conversation with a deterministic narrator system addendum via `build_service_prompt_addendum()`
- ✅ `/base deposit` / `/base withdraw` move items between player Inventory and the base's own storage

**Modular Adventures**
- ✅ `modules.yaml` manifest format + `ModuleRegistry` + `Module` dataclass with `ModuleStatus` enum
- ✅ `load_modules()` validates schema and ingests referenced lore files via `WorldRAG.ingest_file()`
- ✅ `ModuleRegistry.reevaluate(quest_log)` runs post-turn, transitions module statuses monotonically, surfaces unlock/completion notifications
- ✅ `/modules` command lists declared modules by lifecycle status

**Author Tooling**
- ✅ `rag-quest validate-module <dir>` — non-interactive sanity checker with DFS cycle detection on the completion-quest → unlock dependency graph
- ✅ `rag-quest new-module <dir>` — interactive Rich-prompt manifest author with auto-slug, prereq auto-wiring, lore-stub generation, and rollback-on-validation-failure

**`.rqworld` Packaging**
- ✅ Exporter `source_dir` parameter bundles `modules.yaml` + referenced lore with Zip-Slip guard
- ✅ `WorldImporter.extract_to()` unpacks to disk with matching Zip-Slip guard
- ✅ Metadata `version` now tracks `rag_quest.__version__` (was hardcoded `0.5.0` since v0.5)

**Save format v3**
- ✅ `save_version` → 3; `world.bases` and `world.module_registry` round-trip through `World.to_dict` / `from_dict`
- ✅ v2 saves load with empty collections (clean-break policy)

**Dependency**: pyyaml>=6.0

---

## v0.6.0 — Campaign Memory

**Status**: ✅ Complete — AI Notetaker, Lore Encyclopedia, Player Journal & Timeline shipped as pure additive layers over existing GameState, LightRAG, and state_parser.

### What's New in v0.6.0

**AI Notetaker** (hybrid-trigger)
- ✅ Auto-refresh on save events (both auto-save and `/save`)
- ✅ `/notes` command to view; `/notes refresh` to force update
- ✅ Incremental via `last_summarized_turn` cursor — no re-summarizing 500-turn campaigns
- ✅ JSON sidecar at `~/.local/share/rag-quest/notes/{world}.json`
- ✅ Config toggle `notetaker.auto_summary` for cost-sensitive providers

**Canonize**
- ✅ `/canonize N` or `/canonize all` promotes notes into LightRAG with `source="canonized"`
- ✅ Hard boundary — local JSON never silently pollutes retrieval

**Lore Encyclopedia**
- ✅ `/lore` category overview, `/lore <cat>` listing, `/lore <cat> <name>` RAG detail
- ✅ Browse NPCs, locations, factions, items from GameState indexes
- ✅ On-demand `WorldRAG.query_world()` for rich descriptions

**Player Journal & Timeline**
- ✅ Every turn emits structured `TimelineEvent` from `StateChange`
- ✅ `/timeline` with type filters (combat, quest, npc, item, location, all)
- ✅ `/bookmark [note]` captures full narrator prose; `/bookmarks` lists saved highlights
- ✅ 2000-event cap with oldest-first rotation; bookmarks never rotate

**Save format v2**
- ✅ `save_version` → 2; v1 saves load with empty memory fields (clean-break policy)

## Key Principles

1. **LightRAG is the Foundation** — The knowledge graph is the "long-term memory," not the LLM
2. **Lightweight Narrator** — Keep the LLM small; let RAG provide context
3. **Local First** — Ollama + Gemma 4 should be the default experience
4. **No Hallucinations** — RAG grounding ensures narrative consistency
5. **Consumer Hardware** — Everything should run on a Mac or modest GPU
6. **Zero Friction** — Setup should be friendly and automatic
7. **Full Backwards Compatibility** — All saves and worlds should migrate cleanly

---

## Release Cadence

- Major versions (v0.x.0): 1-2 months between releases
- Bug fixes (v0.x.1): As needed
- Documentation: Continuous
